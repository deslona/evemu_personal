# Disclaimer

***EVEmu is an educational project.***
 This means, our primary interest is to learn and teach us
and our users more about C++ project development in a large
scale. Our software is not intended for running public servers,
and we do not support that. We are not responsible for what others
do with the source code downloaded from this project.
